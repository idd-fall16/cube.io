Control the mouse, keyboard, and read the screen.\n\nRobotJS supports Mac, [Windows](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/2), and [Linux](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/17).\n\nThis is a work in progress so the exported functions could change at any time before the first stable release (1.0.0). [Ideas?](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/4)\n\n[Check out some of the cool things people are making with  RobotJS](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Projects-using-RobotJS)! Have your own rad RobotJS project? Feel free to add it!\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/robotjavascript\"><img width=\"300\" src=\"https://cldup.com/Et-C6_ue45.png\"></a><a href=\"http://blog.robotjs.io\"><img width=\"300\" src=\"https://cldup.com/3apDirNmSB.png\"></a></p>\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Examples](#examples)\n- [API](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax)\n- [Building](#building)\n- [Plans](#plans)\n- [Progress](#progress)\n- [FAQ](#faq)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall RobotJS using npm:\n\n```\nnpm install robotjs\n```\nIt's that easy! npm will download one of the prebuilt [binaries](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/releases/latest) for your OS.\n\nYou can get npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it installed.\n\nIf you need to build RobotJS, see the [building](#building) section.\n\n## Examples\n\n##### [Mouse](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax#mouse)\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/lugVjjAkEi.gif\"></p>\n\n```JavaScript\n//Move the mouse across the screen as a sine wave.\nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n//Speed up the mouse.\nrobot.setMouseDelay(2);\n\nvar twoPI = Math.PI * 2.0;\nvar screenSize = robot.getScreenSize();\nvar height = (screenSize.height / 2) - 10;\nvar width = screenSize.width;\n\nfor (var x = 0; x < width; x++)\n{\n\ty = height * Math.sin((twoPI * x) / width) + height;\n\trobot.moveMouse(x, y);\n}\n```\n\n##### [Keyboard](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax#keyboard)\n\n```JavaScript\n//Type \"Hello World\" then press enter.\nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n//Type \"Hello World\".\nrobot.typeString(\"Hello World\");\n\n//Press enter. \nrobot.keyTap(\"enter\");\n```\n\n##### [Screen](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax#screen)\n\n```JavaScript\n//Get pixel color under the mouse. \nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n//Get mouse position. \nvar mouse = robot.getMousePos();\n\n//Get pixel color in hex format. \nvar hex = robot.getPixelColor(mouse.x, mouse.y);\nconsole.log(\"#\" + hex + \" at x:\" + mouse.x + \" y:\" + mouse.y);\n```\nRead the [Wiki](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki) for more information!\n\n## [API](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax)\n\nThe [RobotJS API](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax) is contained in the [Wiki](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki).\n\n## Building\n\nPlease ensure you have the required dependencies before installing:\n\n* Windows\n  * Visual Studio 2013 (Express works fine).\n  * Python (v2.7.3 recommended, v3.x.x is not supported).\n* Mac\n  * Xcode Command Line Tools.\n* Linux\n  * Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x is not supported).\n  * make.\n  * A C/C++ compiler like GCC.\n  * libxtst-dev and libpng++-dev (`sudo apt-get install libxtst-dev libpng++-dev`).\n\nInstall node-gyp using npm:\n\n```\nnpm install -g node-gyp\n```\n\nThen build:\n\n```\nnode-gyp rebuild\n```\n\nSee the [node-gyp readme](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for more details.\n\n## Plans\n\n* √ Control the mouse by changing the mouse position, left/right clicking, and dragging.\n* √ Control the keyboard by pressing keys, holding keys down, and typing words.\n* √ Read pixel color from the screen and capture the screen.\n* Find an image on screen, read pixels from an image.\n* Possibly include window management?\n\n## Progress\n\n| Module        | Status        | Notes   |\n| ------------- |-------------: | ------- |\n| Mouse         | 100%           | All planned features implemented.       |\n| Keyboard      | 100%           | All planned features implemented.       |\n| Screen        | 85%            | Image search, pixel search. |\n| Bitmap        | 0%             |  Saving/opening, png support.  |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Does RobotJS support global hotkeys? \n\nNot currently, and I don't know if it ever will. I personally use [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)/[NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) for global hotkeys, and this works well. Later on I might add hotkey support or create a separate module. See [#55](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/55) for details. \n\n#### Can I take a screenshot with RobotJS? \n\nSoon! This is a bit more complicated than the rest of the features, so I saved it for last. Luckily the code is already there, I just need to write the bindings, and I've already started. Subscribe to [#13](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/13) for updates. \n\n#### Why is &#60;insert key&#62; missing from the keyboard functions? \n\nWe've been implementing keys as we need them. Feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request!\n\n#### How about multi-monitor support?\n\nThe library doesn't have explicit multi-monitor support, so anything that works is kind of on accident. Subscribe to [#88](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/88) for updates.\n\nFor any other questions please [submit an issue](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/new).\n\n## Story\n\nI'm a huge fan of [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), and I've used it for a very long time. AutoHotkey is great for automation and it can do a bunch of things that are very difficult in other languages. For example, it's [imagesearch](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/ImageSearch.htm) and [pixel](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/PixelGetColor.htm) related functions are hard to reproduce on Mac, especially in scripting languages. These functions are great for automating apps that can't be automated like [Netflix](http://blueshirtdesign.com/apps/autoflix/). This has never been a big deal since I've always used Windows at work, but for the past few years I've been using Mac exclusively. \n\nI like AutoHotkey, but I like Node.js more. By developing RobotJS I get an AutoHotkey replacement on Mac (finally!), and I get to use my favorite language. \n\n**TLDR:** There's nothing like AutoHotkey on Mac, so I'm making it. \n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\nBased on [autopy](https://github.com/msanders/autopy). \nMaintained by [Jason Stallings](http://jason.stallin.gs).\n",
