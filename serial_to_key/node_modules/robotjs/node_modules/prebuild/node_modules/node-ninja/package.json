It bundles the [gyp](https://code.google.com/p/gyp/)\nproject used by the Chromium team and takes away the pain of dealing with the\nvarious differences in build platforms.\n\nMultiple target versions of node are supported (i.e. `0.8`, `0.9`, `0.10`, ..., `1.0`,\netc.), regardless of what version of node is actually installed on your system\n(`node-ninja` downloads the necessary development files for the target version).\n\n#### Features:\n\n * Easy to use, consistent interface\n * Same commands to build your module on every platform\n * Supports multiple target versions of Node\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install -g node-ninja\n```\n\nTODO: review this section, it is out of date.\n\nYou will also need to install:\n\n  * On Unix:\n    * `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is __*not*__ supported)\n    * `make`\n    * A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org)\n  * On Mac OS X:\n    * `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is __*not*__ supported) (already installed on Mac OS X)\n    * [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)\n      * You also need to install the `Command Line Tools` via Xcode. You can find this under the menu `Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads`\n      * This step will install `gcc` and the related toolchain containing `make`\n  * On Windows:\n    * Python ([`v2.7.10`][python-v2.7.10] recommended, `v3.x.x` is __*not*__ supported)\n      * Make sure that you have a PYTHON environment variable, and it is set to drive:\\path\\to\\python.exe not to a folder\n    * Windows XP/Vista/7:\n      * Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2013 ([Express][msvc2013] version works well)\n        * If the install fails, try uninstalling any C++ 2010 x64&x86 Redistributable that you have installed first\n        * If you get errors that the 64-bit compilers are not installed you may also need the [compiler update for the Windows SDK 7.1]\n    * Windows 7/8/10:\n        * Install the latest version of npm (3.3.6 at the time of writing)\n        * Install Python 2.7 from https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/ and make sure its on the System Path\n        * Install Visual Studio Community 2015 Edition. (Custom Install, Select Visual C++ during the installation)\n        * Set the environment variable GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2015\n        * Run the command prompt as Administrator\n        * $ npm install (--msvs_version=2015) <-- Shouldn't be needed if you have set GYP_MSVS_VERSION env\n    * All Windows Versions\n      * For 64-bit builds of node and native modules you will _**also**_ need the [Windows 7 64-bit SDK][win7sdk]\n      * You may need to run one of the following commands if your build complains about WindowsSDKDir not being set, and you are sure you have already installed the SDK:\n\n```\ncall \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.1\\bin\\Setenv.cmd\" /Release /x86\ncall \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.1\\bin\\Setenv.cmd\" /Release /x64\n```\n\nIf you have multiple Python versions installed, you can identify which Python\nversion `node-ninja` uses by setting the '--python' variable:\n\n```\nnode-ninja --python /path/to/python2.7\n```\n\nIf `node-ninja` is called by way of `npm` *and* you have multiple versions of\nPython installed, then you can set `npm`'s 'python' config key to the appropriate\nvalue:\n\n```\nnpm config set python /path/to/executable/python2.7\n```\n\nNote that OS X is just a flavour of Unix and so needs `python`, `make`, and C/C++.\nAn easy way to obtain these is to install XCode from Apple,\nand then use it to install the command line tools (under Preferences -> Downloads).\n\nHow to Use\n----------\n\nTo compile your native addon, first go to its root directory:\n\n```\ncd my_node_addon\n```\n\nThe next step is to generate the appropriate project build files for the current\nplatform. Use `configure` for that:\n\n```\nnode-ninja configure\n```\n\n__Note__: The `configure` step looks for the `binding.gyp` file in the current\ndirectory to process. See below for instructions on creating the `binding.gyp` file.\n\nNow you will have either a `Makefile` (on Unix platforms) or a `vcxproj` file\n(on Windows) in the `build/` directory. Next invoke the `build` command:\n\n```\nnode-ninja build\n```\n\nNow you have your compiled `.node` bindings file! The compiled bindings end up\nin `build/Debug/` or `build/Release/`, depending on the build mode. At this point\nyou can require the `.node` file with Node and run your tests!\n\n__Note:__ To create a _Debug_ build of the bindings file, pass the `--debug` (or\n`-d`) switch when running either the `configure`, `build` or `rebuild` command.\n\n\nThe \"binding.gyp\" file\n----------------------\n\nThe `binding.gyp` file describes the configuration to build your module in [a JSON-like format](https://gyp.gsrc.io/docs/LanguageSpecification.md). This file gets placed in the root of\nyour package, alongside the `package.json` file.\n\nA barebones `gyp` file appropriate for building a node addon looks like:\n\n``` python\n# A minimal gyp file\n{\n  \"targets\": [\n    {\n      \"target_name\": \"binding\",\n      \"sources\": [ \"src/binding.cc\" ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nNote that the file format allows trailing commas, and `#` comments.\n\nCommands\n--------\n\n`node-ninja` accepts the following commands:\n\n| **Command**   | **Description**\n|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------\n| `build`       | Invokes `make`/`msbuild.exe` and builds the native addon\n| `clean`       | Removes the `build` directory if it exists\n| `configure`   | Generates project build files for the current platform\n| `rebuild`     | Runs `clean`, `configure` and `build` all in a row\n| `install`     | Installs node development header files for the given version\n| `list`        | Lists the currently installed node development file versions\n| `remove`      | Removes the node development header files for the given version\n\n`node-gyp` accepts the following command options:\n\n| **Option**         | **Description**\n|:-------------------|:------------------------------------------------\n| `-j n`, `--jobs n` | For `build`: run parallel builds\n| `--silly`, `--loglevel=silly` | Log all progress to console\n| `--verbose`, `--loglevel=verbose` | Log most progress to console\n| `--silent`, `--loglevel=silent` | Don't log anything\n| `--debug`          | Make Debug build (default=Release)\n| `--release`, `--no-debug` | Make Release build\n| `--builddir x` | Build in this directory (default=build)\n\nLicense\n-------\nNode-ninja is licensed under the Mozilla Public License version 2.0.
